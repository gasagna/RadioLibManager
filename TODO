27/05/2023 add dup flag to packets, because we need to be able to receive a packet when the node

- add exponential back off functionality in case the gateway goes down. We will need to
  have some parameters, like: 
    - number of failed ack before we start backing off
    - back off rate
    - maximum delay time
